abstract:
  This study aims to the evaluate the extent to which atmospheric rivers (ARs) contribute to
  extreme precipitation events in the Northeast United States. Synoptic and mesoscale meteorological
  phenomena (e.g, landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs), atmospheric convection, extratropical cyclones,
  and lake-effect snow) associated with, and independent of, ARs were evaluated. Events were
  categorized by season, duration, average precipitation rate, and the presence or absence of an AR.
  Preliminary findings indicate that the shortest event durations and highest precipitation rates occur in
  the summer associated with atmospheric convection. In contrast, winter events tended to feature
  longer duration events with lighter precipitation rates associated with extratropical cyclones. Extreme
  precipitation events were most frequently associated with ARs in the winter and least frequently in
  the summer.

## Introduction and Motivation
Heavy precipitation in the Northeast United States can be attributed to a wide variety of
storm types. {cite:t}`Howarth:2019` evaluated the seasonal trends of Northeast extreme precipitation
events and classified events as either “extratropical cyclone,” “convective,” “associated with tropical
moisture,” “hurricane/tropical storm,”, or “unidentified.” However, their study did not explicitly
address ARs. {cite:t}`Slinskey:2020` evaluated the precipitation and climatology of ARs in the
Northeast U.S. National Climate Assessment Region and found that while ARs occur in all seasons
across the Northeast, they are most frequent in the fall (see [their Fig. 2](#SlinskeyFig2)). {cite:t}`Howarth:2019` and
{cite:t}`Slinskey:2020` both emphasize that although ARs can result in heavy precipitation events in
the Northeast, they are not the only meteorological phenomena responsible for them. This result
largely differs from the West Coast where more than 75% of the top-decile 24 h extreme
precipitation events in portions of northwestern California, Oregon, and Washington were associated
with ARs ({cite:t}`Rutz:2014`; [their Fig. 11](#RutzFig11)). This study therefore seeks to identify and classify extreme
precipitation events in the Northeast United States by their duration, type of weather phenomena,
precipitation rate, and AR association to build upon the previous literature. 

## Methodology

For the purposes of this study, the Northeast United States was defined as Pennsylvania and
New Jersey northward. The time period was from 1 January 2002–31 December 2024. Gridded
hourly precipitation data was obtained from the United States Geological Service (USGS) Stage-IV
Zarr Server. Stage-IV precipitation was chosen for this study due to its high resolution (available on a
4 km by 4 km polar stereographic grid) and quality control from the thirteen National Weather
Service River Forecast Centers. As a result of the multi-sensor observations (e.g., rainfall gauge
reports, mesonet observations, and doppler radar estimates) and human oversight, Stage-IV
represents the highest resolution and most accurate dataset to use for this study.

To establish a definition of extreme precipitation, the 90th percentile of daily (0000–2300
UTC) measurable precipitation (>0.254 mm) for every calendar month was calculated at every grid
point. From the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship, warmer temperatures result in greater moisture.

Considering precipitation efficiency ({cite:t}`Doswell:1996`), the heaviest precipitation rates would
likely occur in the summer when there is the most moisture. Furthermore, since TCs occur in the
summer and fall, one would expect the highest 90th percentile to occur during these months. Since
this study aims to investigate the influence of ARs in Northeast precipitation events, calculating the
90th percentile as a function of month, rather than annually, was necessary to ensure that all
wintertime AR events were captured.

An extreme precipitation event was defined when the 24 h rolling precipitation sum for a
given grid point exceeded the monthly 90th percentile of daily precipitation ([](#Fig1)) [](#nb_Fig1). Inspired by
{cite:t}`Lamjiri:2017`, the start and end time of each event was defined by at least six consecutive
hours of no precipitation. It is important to note that events where the 24 h rolling sum calculated
from the start time of the event never exceeded the 90th percentile were discarded. This exclusion
occurred when the rolling sum exceeded the 90th percentile from precipitation that occurred prior to
the six consecutive hours of dry conditions.

For each precipitation event identified, a precipitation mass centroid in time was calculated to
determine the hour most representative of when the heaviest precipitation occurred. This mass
centroid approach was particularly useful for long duration events where the hourly precipitation was
non-uniform. [](#Fig2) provides an example event that occurred at the grid point closest to John F.
Kennedy Airport in New York City from 0000–1700 UTC 16 April 2018.

Finally, to determine if an AR was present at the time of the centroid of the extreme
precipitation event, the Global Atmospheric Rivers Database Version 4 ({cite:t}`GuanWaliser:2024`)
was utilized. Guan and Waliser identify an AR using a monthly IVT magnitude threshold and several
geometric considerations (e.g., the coherence of IVT and the length to aspect ratio). Since the AR
dataset is six-hourly, the event centroids were rounded to the nearest six-hour mark, with times at the
midpoint (e.g., 0300 UTC and 0900 UTC) rounded down to the previous interval (e.g., 0000 and
0600 UTC). This dataset was used to determine if an AR was present for a given event and to
investigate the spatial extent and proximity of the AR relative to a grid point of interest.

## Results

The total number of extreme rainfall events across the domain was largely influenced by the
topography of the Northeast United States ([](#Fig3)). The greatest number of events occurred in the
highest elevations of the Northeast, such as the Greens, Catskills, Adirondacks, Berkshires, and
Appalachians, where 350–425 events were common. As a result of orographic precipitation
processes, these locations had the greatest number of days with measurable precipitation, and thus
the highest number of cases. Areas prone to lake effect snow across western New York and the Tug
Hill Plateau had an even greater number of cases, between 475–500 events, where numerous days of
measurable precipitation occurred in the winter.

To further understand the meteorological phenomena associated with extreme precipitation in
the Northeast, the events were stratified by month and duration ([](#Fig4)). The lowest average event
durations, between 10–20 hours, occurred during the summer months from May–August. This result
suggests that summer extreme precipitation events are largely associated with atmospheric
convection, which is shorter-lived than extratropical cyclones. April appears to be a transition month
between different atmospheric phenomena. In April, the event duration across much of the domain
was between 15–25 hours. By May, the average event duration was closer to 10–20 hours. This
finding implies that extratropical cyclones are the most common contributor to extreme precipitation
in April and that convection begins to become more of a factor by May. Similarly, September is also
unique as the event duration begins to increase following the summer months. While convection is
still expected to occur in September, TCs and extratropical cyclones associated with increased
baroclinicity could result in longer duration events. Finally, during the winter months, the average
event duration was longest. In particular, the lake effect snow regions have the longest average event
duration in November, December, and January of greater than 30 hours.

Another way to visualize this data is to stratify the cases by duration, average precipitation
rate, season, and AR association for an individual grid point, i.e., Albany, NY ([](#Fig5)). For Albany,
NY, there was a total of 358 events. While all seasons indicated a logarithmic relationship between
average hourly precipitation rate and event duration, this relationship was most pronounced in
summer. During the summer, atmospheric convection is the most dominant storm type. While often
short-lived, convection frequently produces heavy precipitation rates. In contrast, the longest
duration events occurred in winter when extratropical cyclones are most common. These results are
consistent with [](#Fig4). Since the total event precipitation is a function of both the rate and duration of
the precipitation, the event total precipitation is similar across the seasons.

However, the rate and duration of events vary depending on the dominant atmospheric phenomena,
which themselves are seasonally dependent.

As for ARs, an event was said to be associated with an AR if an AR was detected at any grid
point within 1.5º of the Albany grid point. Events were most and least associated with ARs in the
winter and summer respectively ([](#Fig5) and [](#Fig6)). While further work needs to be conducted, a
preliminary hypothesis that may explain these results is that summer into early fall events are more
driven by convection and TCs, reducing the likelihood of association with ARs. Finally, one can
visualize the spatial extent of ARs as a function of season ([](#Fig7)). For all rounded centroids at the
Albany grid point, ARs were most common during the winter throughout the entire domain. The
location of the ARs were also skewed to the east of Albany, which was not a surprise since the closer
one gets to the water, the more frequent the ARs are.

## Concluding Summary

This study provides a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of extreme precipitation
events in the Northeast United States. The duration, precipitation rate, and atmospheric phenomena
responsible for the event were investigated throughout this study. Shorter duration but higher
precipitation intensity events were most frequent during the summer months and were likely
associated with atmospheric convection. Longer duration and lighter precipitation rate events
occurred during the winter when extratropical cyclones are most common. The primary goal of this
study was to evaluate the influence that ARs have in Northeast extreme precipitation events.
Preliminary work found that ARs were most frequent in the winter months and to the east of Albany,
NY. Further investigation of AR associated events needs to be conducted, such as stratifying events
by integrated vapor transport magnitude and comparison to the West Coast.
