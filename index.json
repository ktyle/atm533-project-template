Events were categorized by season, duration, average precipitation rate, and the presence or absence of an AR. Preliminary findings indicate that the shortest event durations and highest precipitation rates occur in the summer associated with atmospheric convection. In contrast, winter events tended to feature longer duration events with lighter precipitation rates associated with extratropical cyclones.

The lowest average event\ndurations, between 10–20 hours, occurred during the summer months from May–August.

By May, the average event duration was closer to 10–20 hours. This\nfinding implies that extratropical cyclones are the most common contributor to extreme precipitation\nin April and that convection begins to become more of a factor by May. Similarly, September is also\nunique as the event duration begins to increase following the summer months. While convection is\nstill expected to occur in September, TCs and extratropical cyclones associated with increased\nbaroclinicity could result in longer duration events. Finally, during the winter months, the average\nevent duration was longest.
